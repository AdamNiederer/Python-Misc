# Python-Doodles
All of the other Python stuff that I write as I learn the language!

##### Maximum Contiguous Subarray Problem
I was posed this problem as homework for my second semester CMPSC 111S seminar class.
Wanting to do better than an obvious O(N^2) brute force solution, I came up with my
own algorithm which operated in O(N) time. Later, I found out about Kadane's algorithm 
(also O(N)), and decided to implement it as well.

##### Midterm Grade Parser
My CMPSC 122 professor posted everyone's midterm grades (along with other grades), so 
I wrote a simple little script to quickly see how midterm scores were distributed by
frequency.
