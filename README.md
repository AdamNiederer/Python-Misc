# Python-Misc
All my other Python stuff!

##### Airplane Seating Problem
This problem was brought up during a CMPSC 111S lecture, and I wanted
to write a simulation to solve the problem. The problem description
is in the script code as a multi-line comment.

##### Maximum Contiguous Subarray Problem
I was posed this problem as homework for my second semester CMPSC 111S seminar class.
Wanting to do better than an obvious O(N^2) brute force solution, I came up with my
own algorithm which operated in O(N) time. Later, I found out about Kadane's algorithm 
(also O(N)), and decided to implement it as well.

##### Markov Chain Text Generation
In preparation for HackPSU Spring 2016, I wanted to play around a little bit with
text generation powered by markov chains. This was made very easy by the markovify
library, but I may try and modify it to my own needs soon.

##### Midterm Grade Parser
My CMPSC 122 professor posted everyone's midterm grades (along with other grades), so 
I wrote a simple little script to quickly see how midterm scores were distributed by
frequency.
